# Networking Start Pack

## OSI 7-Layer Model
The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model is a framework that describes the functions and interactions of computer systems in a network.

- Local Networking: Ethernet (start / end point of data moving across internet)
- Routing: Moving data across multiple networks
- Segmenting, Ports, and Sessions
- Applications

1. Physical
2. Data Link
3. Network
4. Transport
5. Session
6. Presentation
7. Application
^ These 7 layers are the "Networking Stack". 1-3 are Media Layers, 4-7 are Host Layers

### Layer 1 - Physical
Imagine you have two laptops at home and you want to LAN game between the two. You have a physical connection/medium between the two laptops (network interface card, network cable).

Physical Medium: can be Copper (electrical), fiber (light), of WiFi (RF). 

A Layer 3 device has the capabilities of all layers under it (3, 2, and 1). A Layer 1 device only has the capabilities of Layer 1, as no layers are below it.
