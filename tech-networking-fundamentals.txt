# Networking Start Pack

## OSI 7-Layer Model
The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model is a framework that describes the functions and interactions of computer systems in a network.

- Local Networking: Ethernet (start / end point of data moving across internet)
- Routing: Moving data across multiple networks
- Segmenting, Ports, and Sessions
- Applications

1. Physical
2. Data Link
3. Network
4. Transport
5. Session
6. Presentation
7. Application
^ These 7 layers are the "Networking Stack". 1-3 are Media Layers, 4-7 are Host Layers

### Layer 1 - Physical
Imagine you have two laptops at home and you want to LAN game between the two. You have a physical connection/medium between the two laptops (network interface card, network cable).

Physical Medium: can be Copper (electrical), fiber (light), of WiFi (RF). 

A Layer 3 device has the capabilities of all layers under it (3, 2, and 1). A Layer 1 device only has the capabilities of Layer 1, as no layers are below it.

There are no individual device addresses at Layer 1. Anything received on any port is transmitted out on every other port (including errors and collisions). If multiple devices transmit on the same level 1 physical medium, a collision occurs and corrupts data. The more layer 1 devices connected, the more likely a collision.

Layer 1 is "dumb". 1 broadcast and 1 collision domain, not very scalable. No access control. No uniquely identifiable devices. so no device-to-device communication.

### Layer 2 - Data Link (DL)
Data Link adds lots of intelligence to layer 1, allowing for more effective communication. DL all higher layers rely on Layer 2 as it supports the transfer of data.

Rather than physical wavelengths or voltages, but uses "frames". Devices at L2 have a unique hardware (MAC) address. Frames can be addressed to a destination or to a broadcast.

Frame is a container of sorts.
- First is PREAMBLE (let's device know this is start of the frame
- Destination and Source MAC addresses
- EtherType: which layer 3 protocol is putting its data in a frame
- Payload: The data the frame carries from source to destination
- Frame Check Sequence (FCS): Confirm it corruption has occurred

Mac Header = Source MAC address + Destination MAC address + EtherType

In order to have active Layer 2 network, you need Layer 1 active and working. Layer 2 checks for carriers, if no carriers, Frame is sent to Layer 1 for transmission. Carrier detected? Wait, as another device is transmitting.

CSMA: Carrier Sense Multiple Access. Detects data to avoid collision.

Encapsulation: When data is wrapped in by a Frame. As data is passed down OSI model, many different components encapsulate the data.

Collision Detection at layer 2. If both devices check for carrier which doesn't exist, then both L2's instruct transmission via layer 1, a collision can occur. If collision is detected, jam signal is sent and a random backoff occurs. Backoff = time + random. It increases if another collision occurs.

Hub = layer 1 device. Dumb, send data to all ports.
Switch = layer 2 device. Maintains MAC address table to learn what's connected to each port. Intelligent; store and forward Frames appropriately, based on MAC address table. Won't forward collisions. Each port becomes a separate collision domain.

- Identifiable devices
- Media Access Control (sharing)
- Collision Detection
- Unicast 1:1
- Broadcast 1:ALL
- Switches

### Layer 3 - Network
Requires 1 or more Layer 2 networks to function. Layer 3 gets data from one location to another. With streaming, data moved from server hosting video to local device.

#### Why is Layer 3 needed?
If we have two local area networks with geographic separation (east/west coast US separation). LAN1 and LAN2 are isolated Layer 2 local networks right now. You *could* use point to point physical links across the distance, but this is costly. Layer 2 protocols can be different so connecting to L2 networks can be challenging. We need something in common between the two L2's. To move data between two local networks... inter-networking ==> internet. IP addresses can be assigned as a way to connect separated L2 networks.

- Routers are the hardware that L3 uses to encapsulate data in an IP packet.

- IP allows you to connect to remote networks, allowing you to cross over intermediary networks in between.

Packet: Data unit used in IP. Similar to Frames (L2). Every packet has a Source IP and Destination IP address.

- Two versions of IP in use. Version 4 and Version 6.
-- Destination/Source IP addresses are larger in v6 to allow for more.

#### L3: IP Addressing (IPv4)
Structure of an IP address. This section focuses on v4.

IP Address
133 . 33 . 3 . 7
- Dotted decimal notation from 0 - 255
- All IP addresses formed of two different partsL 1) Network (133.33), 2) Hosts (3.7)
- You can see if two IP addresses are on same network if the first half matches (both being 133.33)
- 4 sets of 8 bits, 32 bits total for IP address. Each number in IP Address is an octet
- /16 prefix. First 16 bits are network, last 16 bits are host
- Static IP: assigned by humans. DHCP: Machine assigned IPs
- IP addresses need to be unique, esp on local network

Subnet Masks: ID's host and network parts of IP addresses. So it can know when to send data on same local network, or use a router to transport across different networks. Configured on L3 along with IP addresses. Allows an IP device to know if IP is on same network or not. If not on same network, data is sent to Default Gateway (router)
- e.g. 255.255.0.0 is a subnet mask, and is the same as the /16 prefix (when broken down into binary)

#### L3: Route Tables & Routes
How a router decides where to send data.

Every router has at least 1 route table. This is how a router knows where to send data. Two fields: 1) destination field 2) Next Hop/Target. The larger the prefix, the more specific the route (/0, /16, /32). Routers prefer more specific routes.  

/24 = first 24 bits for network, last 8 bits are for host.

Default Route: 0.0.0.0/0 = matches if nothing else does.

IMPORTANT: When ISP router is forwarding packet to AWS router, it's forwarding it at Level 2; wrapped in a Frame. How do we determine MAC address of AWS router? Address Resolution Protocol

#### L3: Address Resolution Protocol
Used when Layer 3 packet needs to be encapsulated in a Frame and sent to MAC address. You don't know the MAC address, but you need to get it. This is where ARP comes in. 
- ARP will give you MAC address with given IP address
- ARP broadcasts on Layer 2

#### L3: IP Routing
Lengthy example, not a very great visual. Recommend looking up another video on YouTube for IP Routing Explanation
