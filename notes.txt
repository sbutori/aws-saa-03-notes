## How to get started
Don't start with the Cloud Practitioner Foundational Cert, start with Associate level SA (Solutions Architect). The content overlaps.
After you finish SA Associate do the Role Based certs, then Specialty certs later. Get SA Professional prior to Specialties certs
- In Associate level, start with 1. SA before SysOps/Developer 2. then Developer Associate 3. then SysOps Associate (Hardest exam of the 3).
- In Professional level, tests are way harder. Longer questions, more questions. 1. Professional SA, 2. DevOps Pro exam

# Scenario - Animals4life

Animal rescue/awareness Org. Global company, 100 staff, 100 remote staff, etc etc. Small data-center is old, and data should be migrated out. 
Badly implemented AWS trial in SYD Region. Isolated Azure/GCP Pilots. All staff uses this infrastructure. Company runs lean but will get new tech
if it helps business. 
- On Premise: 192.168.10.0/24, Class C
- AWS Pilot: 10.0.0.0/16, Class B
- Azure Pilot: 172.31.0.0/16, Class B
Major offices NY, Seattle, London all use Head Office services for data
Field workers on laptop, 3g/4g/ satellite for email/files, chat/planning, research data

Problems: Hardware failing, datacenter decommissioned in 18months, so business needs to migrate out. New investment needed, not sure if on premise, azure, aws, etc. Previous AWS/Azure attempts didn't pan out. Distance to datacenter is sub-optimal for much of company. Lean/appropriately sized, but trouble with peak traffic. IT team sucks at cloud.

Ideal Outcomes: 
- Fast performance for all field workers
- Able to deploy into new regions quickly when required
- Low cost and scalable base infrastructure, cost close to 0 as possible while meeting reqs
- Agility - new marketing campaigns, social and progressive applications (IOT, Big Data, etc). Wants to make use of emerging technologies
- Automation - low base staffing costs

Pay attention to which areas need more information, so you can ask the right questions.
