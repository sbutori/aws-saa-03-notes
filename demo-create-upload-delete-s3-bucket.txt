### DEMO: Creating an S3 Bucket
Create, interact with bucket, upload to bucket, interact with uploaded objects
- As S3 is Global, you can't select a Region in advance

STEPS: Move to S3 Console > click 'Create bucket' > name 'koalacampaign987654123' (must be globally unique) > select Region (default N.VA) > untick "Block *all* Public Access (this just enables you to Enable public access later) > click "Create Bucket" 

#### Amazon Resource Name (ARN): All resources in AWS have a unique identifier, the ARN. 
To see bucket ARN, Amazon S3 > Buckets > click the bucket you want > 'Properties' tab > Amazon Resource Name 

#### DEMO: Upload files to Bucket
Amazon S3 > Buckets > click the bucket you want > Objects, click Upload > Select Files > Use default settings > click Upload
- Now, you'll see these files in the Object tab

Note on creating a folder: it doesn't actually create a folder, it creates an object that appears to be a folder. They are just emulated using prefixes Eg. archive/koalazzz.jpg -> Not actually a file, but named to look like it
- Without versioning enabled, same name files can overwrite each other. With Versioning, they can't

#### DEMO: Delete Buckets in S3
Two step process:
1. Empty the bucket > select Bucket, click Empty
2. Re-select Bucket, click Delete
